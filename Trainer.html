    <h1>Trainers</h1>

    <div><p>A fitness trainer is someone who leads, instructs, and motivates individuals or groups in exercise activities, including cardiovascular exercise (exercises for the heart and blood system), strength training, and stretching. They work with people of all ages and skill levels.</p>
    <p>
        Personal fitness trainers design and carry out workout routines specific to the needs of their clients. In larger facilities, personal trainers must often sell their training sessions to members. They start by evaluating their clients' current fitness level, personal goals, and skills. They then develop personalized training programs for their clients to follow, and they monitor the clients’ progress.
